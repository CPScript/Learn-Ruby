# You can write a comment that spans multiple lines by starting each line with a #, but thereâ€™s an easier way. If you start with =begin and end with =end, everything between those two expressions will be a comment. Take a look at this example:

=begin
Im a comment without a #
But im in a multy line comment
LOL
=end

# im a sigle line comment :)
